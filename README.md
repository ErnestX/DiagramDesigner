# DiagramDesigner
Screen Recording (alpha): https://vimeo.com/591414378 

A Windows application that intends to make computational design more like sketching than math. The core feature is to run layout optimization algorithms on shape grammars to produce architecture program diagrams that both follow the aesthetic rules and satisfy the program requirements. Most importantly, the shape grammars are to be machine-learned from the sketched examples provided by the designer.
